## Overview

This project aims to highlight vernacular Malay periodicals published in Singapore towards the end of the nineteenth and during the first part of the twentieth century, up to the onset of independence in the Malay Archipelago. Individuals inextricably linked to these periodicals will be illuminated. Materials pertaining to these individuals, periodicals and their other writings within NUS Libraries’ collection will be showcased. In this overview, a brief history of Malay publishing is outlined up to the genesis of these periodicals.

## Brief History of Malay Printing in Singapore

### Early Autochtonous Works

The *Sejarah Melayu* (Malay Annals), originally titled *Sulalat al-Salatin* (Genealogy of Kings), is one of the more well-known early works originating from the Malay World, specifically Malacca. The *Sejarah Melayu* was first mentioned in Petrus van der Vorm's *Introduction to the Malayan Vocabulary of Gueynier* (1708), and later in pertinent works such as Francois Valentijn's *Oud en Nieuw Oost-Indiën* (1726) and William Marsden's *A History of Sumatera* (1811). It gained prominence in 1821 following John Leyden's English translation of the text. It is commonly agreed upon that the author of the *Sejarah Melayu* is Tun Seri Lanang and that the work has undergone numerous edits, with the earliest dated back to 1612.[^1]

The *Sulalat al-Salatin* essentially began as a king list which mentions periods of reign with dates, giving concise information about individual rulers. This kinglist was subsequently embellished by various stories and historically relevant materials inserted in suitable places, but at the same time it lost its dates.[^2]

A lesser known work which served as an alternative discourse and critique against the rulers is the *Bustan al-Salatin* (The Garden of Kings), written in 1638. Unlike the *Sulalat al-Salatin* which serves to legitimise rulers and their reign, *Bustan al-Salatin* is a work about state and statecraft. The *Bustan places* emphasis primarily on guiding principles for rulers to carry out their duties. The author of the *Bustan*, Nuruddin al-Raniri is one of the earliest writers in traditional Malay literature who had awareness of personal authorship; he clearly wrote his full name and his origins, unlike the author of *Sulalat al-Salatin*.[^3]

Another work of the same calibre is the *Taj al-Salatin* (The Crown of Kings) by Bukhari al-Jauhari. The Taj is a Malay literary classic of the nasihat or 'mirrors for princes' genre, written in 1603. Its main aim is to establish guidelines for good governance and just kingship in line with Islamic tradition. It advises kings on the norms of proper and just governance in literary form. It also places emphasis on the rulers' role as the servant of God on earth.[^4]

### Malay Printing in Singapore

Many mission imprints in Malay were printed in Singapore, by the likes of Thomson's Mission Press. Christian publications in Malay continued to be printed at Mission Press at Zion Hill until the 1860s. The first indigenous Malay printers and publishers emerged after. The best-documented and researched publications of the late nineteenth century in the Archipelago are Malay newspapers and periodicals. They are valued as indicators of contemporary social and political thought. The first Malay newspaper, *Jawi Peranakan*, emerged in 1876 and ran weekly until 1895.[^5]

### Modern Printing in the Malay Archipelago

For the longest time, the only centre of printing was in Batavia (present-day Jakarta), which came under the control of Vereenigde Oost-Indische Compagnie (VOC; Dutch East India Company) in 1619. The first Malay book to be printed in the Archipelago was Frederick Gueynier's 1677 edition of a previous Malay-Dutch dictionary by Caspar Wiltens and Sebastian Danckaerts (originally published in 1623 in 's Gravenhage). Malay-language printing began in the peninsula firstly in Melaka in 1817. C. H. Thomsen and Munsyi Abdullah later established Malay language printing in Singapore in 1822.[^6]

### Modern Printing of Malay Books

The first Malay books were printed in seventeenth-century Europe, with the Netherlands leading the field of Malay printing. Eighteenth-century publications were mainly limited to lexicographical and Christian works. In the nineteenth century, subject categories widened to include literary and general works as well as schoolbooks.[^7] Generally, three broad categories of interest can be identified – travelogues written and compiled by adventurers, sailors and other travellers; dictionaries and grammar books on Malay and other languages produced by missionaries such as Francois Valentijn; and early interest in the flora and fauna of the Malay Archipelago.[^8] England, too, has a couple of Malay works published. A code of Malay laws was printed in the jawi script in London in 1821 and in the same year the complete Bible was printed in Malay in Chelsea by Tiling and Hughes.[^9]
