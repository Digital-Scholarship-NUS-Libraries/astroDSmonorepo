The best-documented and researched publications of the late nineteenth century in the Archipelago are Malay newspapers and periodicals. They are valued as indicators of contemporary social and political thought. This section will highlight pertinent periodicals published in Singapore whose key figures were prominent in the discourse on identity and nationalism. The periodicals showcased are by no means exhaustive and are primarily highlighted due to the key individuals involved with these periodicals, and the periodicals’ significance in raising consciousness among the community. Jawi Peranakan was the first Malay periodical printed in Singapore. There were other Malay newspapers that were established after that. Utusan Melayu, which ran from 1939 to 1942, was the very first wholly owned, managed and financed by Malays. The Japanese occupation, which began in 1942, incapacitated the whole network of Malay newspapers.
