This project[^1] aims to highlight vernacular Malay periodicals published in Singapore towards the end of the nineteenth and during the first part of the twentieth century, up to the onset of independence in the Malay Archipelago. Individuals inextricably linked to these periodicals will be illuminated. Materials pertaining to these individuals, periodicals and their other writings within NUS Librariesâ€™ collection will be showcased. In this overview, a brief history of Malay publishing is outlined up to the genesis of these periodicals.
