          This interactive geovisualization platform is created in fulfilment of
          the project on “Linking the Digital Humanities to Biodiversity History
          in Singapore and Southeast Asia”, funded by the Singapore Social
          Science Research Council (SSRTG Type A).

          The platform displays the locality of first published records of
          established animal species (Animal Map) and plant species (Plant Map)
          in Singapore from 1819 onwards. The Animal Map page contains togglable
          historical maps for reference as well.
